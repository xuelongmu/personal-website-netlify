## And [here's my repo!](https://github.com/kdevo/osprey-delight)

Osprey **De**light is a sugar-free version of the [awesome Osprey theme](https://github.com/tomanistor/osprey) by [Toma Nistor](https://tomanistor.com/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It tastes a bit different than the original (hence the "light" in the name) but also adds some new functionality -- hopefully to your **delight**.

Have fun using it! {{< icon "rocket icon-pulse-fast" >}}
